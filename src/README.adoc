nng - nanomsg-NG
================

This repository represents a work in progress rewrite of the SP protocol
library called "libnanomsg".  The work is being done by Garrett D'Amore,
and at this juncture he is *not* soliciting assistance.

This is a work in progress, and is *not* for general use or publication.
When the library is ready for broader consumption, an announcement will
be posted on the nanomsg mailing list and website.

If you are looking for the current production version of nanomsg, please
see the https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg site.

Note that commit histories here are subject to change in the future --
once the production reaches a point that we are ready to start using
issue tracking and so forth, we will compress the existing deltas into
a single commit.  This is probably some number of weeks in the future.
