About This Directory
====================

This directory contains support files that I use for developing this
project.  I recommend others consider doing the same.

I'm using Sublime Text as my development IDE, and so I've set things up
for that.

The project coding style is automatically checked by the Uncrustify
configuration, and there is a shell script here that will validate it.
Uncrustify is not (for now) enforced outside of src/  (in particular it
will probably choke on the stuff in ./tests).  I may fix that one day.

I have the arranged in my Uncrustify Sublime package to configure both
the location of the binary, and the location of the configuration, so that
Alt-U will autoformat my buffer.  I've also arranged for Sublime text to
understand that .h is C, not C++ (this is important!)

If/when Sublime Text gets better support for storing project-specific
settings for things like package settings, then I'll post the relevant
settings file(s) here.
