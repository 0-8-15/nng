NAME
----
nng - nanomsg next generation

SYNOPSIS
--------
*cc* ['flags'] 'files' *-lnng* ['libraries']


DESCRIPTION
-----------

The _nng_ library provides a common messaging framework intended to
solve common communication problems in distributed applications.
It offers a number of _protocols_, and also a number of _transports_.

The _protocols_ implement the semantics associated with particular
communications scenarios, such as RPC style services, service discovery,
publish/subscribe, and so forth.

The _transports_ provide support for underlying transport methods, such
as TCP, IPC, websockets, and so forth.

The _nng_ library is designed to permit easy creation of new _transports_ and,
to a lesser extent, new _protocols_.

The _nng_ library is wire compatible with the SP protocols described in
the nanomsg project; projects using _libnanomsg_ can interoperate with
nng as well as other conforming implementations.  (One such implementation
is the https://github.com/go-mangos/mangos[mangos].  Applications using _nng_
which wish to communicate with older libraries must ensure that they only
use protocols or transports offered by the earlier library.

The _nng_ library also offers a compatible API, permitting legacy code to
be recompiled or relinked against _nng_.  When doing this, support for
certain enhancements or features will likely be absent, requiring the
application developer to use the new-style API.

The _nng_ library is implemented in pure C; if you need bindings for
other languages please check the http://nanomsg.org/[website].
