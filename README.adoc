This repository represents a work in progress rewrite of the SP protocol
library called "libnanomsg".  This is pre-release, but at this point you
can start using it for development, as we believe we are getting closer
to release readiness.

Review and testing feedback are appreciated however; but please understand
that the project is still quite preliminary.

This is a work in progress, and is *not* suitable for production use or
publication.  When the library is ready for broader consumption, an
announcement will be posted on the nanomsg mailing list and website.

Some https://nanomsg.github.io/nng/man/[manual pages] are posted
on GitHub pages.

If you are looking for the current production version of nanomsg, please
see the https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg[nanomsg repo].

If you want to build and test yourself, you need CMake version 3.1, and
you can use standard CMake build recipes.  On a Linux/UNIX system, 
you can for example do:

[source,sh]
----
  $ mkdir build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  $ make test
----

If you want to enable the TLS transport, which is not supported by legacy
nanomsg, use -DNNG_TRANSPORT_TLS=ON in your cmake command line.  You will
need to have the ARM mbedTLS library installed.  (This is available in
Xenial Ubuntu as libmbedtls-dev).

The API is not yet documented, but if you want to explore using the newer
API, pleaes have a look at the `nng.h` header file.  A legacy compatible
`nng_compat.h` header is available and offers API compatibility with legacy
_nanomsg_.
