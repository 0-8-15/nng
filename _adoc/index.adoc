This is the documentation for _nng_.

The Reference Manual is available for browsing <<man/index#,here>>.

You can also development and documentation efforts for _nng_ by purchasing your own copy of the https://leanpub.com/nngmanual[NNG Reference Manual on Leanpub].

Here is my <<RATIONALE#,rationale>> for why I made _nng_.

My presentation, https://staysail.github.io/nng_presentation/nng_presentation.html[Scalability Protocols], from February 2018, also has some more detail
about these protocols and NNG in particular.

Please see the https://github.com/nanomsg/nng[GitHub Repository] for further information.
